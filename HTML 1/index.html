    <!-- Biography -->
    <section id="bio">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Joseph Aziguene, and I am the firstborn in a family of five.
        Growing up in a tight-knit family has shaped my perspective on
        responsibility, hard work, and determination. My mother, a retired
        nurse, has always been a beacon of strength and inspiration, showing me
        the value of perseverance and selflessness. On the other hand, my
        father, who is also retired, taught me resilience and the importance of
        staying hopeful even during challenging times. I am currently pursuing a
        degree in Petroleum and Gas Engineering at the University of Lagos. This
        field has taught me the significance of precision, problem-solving, and
        adaptability, which are invaluable skills I aim to bring to the tech
        world. My passion for technology, particularly in frontend engineering,
        stems from a desire to create innovative solutions that address
        real-world problems and improve lives.

    <!-- Why I joined AltSchool section -->
    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why I Joined the AltSchool Africa Program</h2>
      <p>
        The ALT School of Engineering program represents an exciting opportunity
        to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical
        application. Traditional academic institutions often focus heavily on
        theory, leaving little room for hands-on learning. ALT School, with its
        emphasis on functional and practical education, fills this gap
        effectively. My decision to join the program is also driven by my
        passion for learning cutting-edge technologies in a structured yet
        flexible environment. Through the program, I aim to refine my skills in
        frontend development, backend engineering, and cloud solutions.
        Moreover, the program aligns perfectly with my belief that technology
        should be used to create impactful solutions that make the world a
        better place.

    <!-- My Goals for the SOE program -->
    <section id="goals">
      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My ultimate goal for the ALT School School of Engineering program is to
        become a proficient software engineer with expertise in frontend
        engineering and its related fields. I aspire to build web applications
        that are not only functional but also visually appealing and
        user-friendly. Additionally, I want to master the art of problem-solving
        through technology by working on real-world projects and collaborating
        with industry professionals. Beyond technical skills, I hope to develop
        soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership, which are
        essential for a successful career in tech. I also aim to secure a
        scholarship or internship opportunity that will allow me to contribute
        to meaningful projects while gaining valuable experience.
